# Deep Learning | HA1: Reproducing ResNet on FashionMNIST-Resplit
# Instructions:
• Your answers should be typed, not handwritten. 
• You may submit PDF only. The PDF must be a text-based (searchable) PDF, not an image-only/scanned PDF. Image-based PDFs will not be accepted. 
• Submissions must be made via Canvas. 
• Please note that the dataset is sourced from Lab 3.

# Objective
Reproduce the core idea of ResNet (convolutional neural network with residual connections) and evaluate it on the FashionMNIST-Resplit dataset. You will implement the model, run experiments, and write a concise technical report. 
# Tasks
1. Implement ResNet. 
• Implement the main ResNet building blocks (convolutional stem, residual blocks, skip connections, and normalization such as BatchNorm, as described in the paper). 
• You may choose any reasonable training pipeline (e.g., PyTorch, transformers.Trainer, etc.). 
2. Run experiments on FashionMNIST-Resplit. 
• Train your model and report results on the provided split. 
• You may choose any hyperparameters and training budget. 
3. Write a Technical Report. Your report must clearly cover: 
(a) Implementation: what you implemented and how it matches the paper (architecture details, key design choices, and any deviations). 
(b) Experimental results: quantitative results and essential training details (e.g., optimizer, learning rate, epochs, batch size). 
(c) Conclusions: your main takeaways, supported by evidence. 
(d) Additional notes: any extra ablations, visualizations, troubleshooting, or negative results you consider informative. 
# Submission
• Report: a PDF technical report.
